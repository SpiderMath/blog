Hi all! This page is to maintain a list of the certificates I've gathered over the years while learning new things. Every course that I try out has a story, and I strive to document those all! <br>

This is the first attempt at trying to organise the certificates, so let me know if you have any suggestions so as to how I could improve my presentation ^_^ <br>
