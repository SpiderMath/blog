{{<lead>}}Notes are a great way to revise and better understand new concepts (>_<){{</lead>}}

This page is for maintaining a list of my notes of the various courses I've undertaken and resources I've used to study. They may be textual or written, I don't know which they will be!  

Feel free to go through all of the materials as per your interests. For better access, here's a few categories of notes I'm putting for easier access. ❤️

- [Online courses](./tags/online-course)
- [B.Math](./tags/bmath-isibc)
- [Self-Studied Books](./tags/self-study)
