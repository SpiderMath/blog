# spidermath.github.io

Hey there! Here's my personal website hosted using GitHub pages. It has been built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and [Blowfish](https://blowfish.pages) to act as my personal blog and display of projects and plans!  

Here is the setup instructions.

## Pre-requisites

- Install and setup [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)

## Steps

1. Clone this repository using
```sh
$ git clone "https://github.com/spidermath/spidermath.github.io.git"
```
2. Change into the cloned repository
```sh
$ cd spidermath.github.io
```
3. Run `blowfish-tools` to serve the site
```sh
$ npx blowfish-tools
```

## How to add new content?

All of the written content is in [`content`](./content/). The rest is auto-generated by `blowfish-tools` with slight modifications of the settings, or so it is as of now.
